###  Message

"Metajj. Metajj... how far have you come... we owe it to you that the galaxy's most powerful forces are mere puppets for our machinations. We've induldged in shadow play for as long as was needed. Now that both the First Order and the Resistance have secured us as their ally - We shall be true to neither. They've mistaken usefulness for trust, and it shall cost them dearly! Go now, to the Orbital Research Station on Vesper V. There you will recover the technology we need to end this war. Soon we shall lift our Pharosi veil, and herald the era of the Narrow Eclipse!"

###  Message

"Greetings Pharosi Vos. Starkiller Base was lost. Our home .. our memories .. most of our men... lost. These were men. Great men, sacrificed on the altar of a singular power. A power that hungers still, and it wants to devour the resitance whole... Pharosi Vos, we shall pay you considerable credits for retrieving Kyber Crystals. I'll forgo giving offence by suggesting it would make for a good retirement - we both know it's not the credits you're in for. You understand power. So you understand we must respond in kind. We shall need Kyber Crystals, Vos. All of them."

The Pharosi have sent a small batch of Kyber Crystals to the Finalizer - but not nearly enough to run your experiments with. With pride you explain how _Kyber Troopers_ will be Force Enhanced Stormtroopers. Soon the First Order will unleash a thousand mini death stars upon the universe!

###  Message

"Commander Vos. All that's left of Starkiller base are the blueprints you handed us! We are forever indebted to the Pharosi! Though we once again seek your counsel. With the Senate on Hosnian Prime obliterated, the New Republic is leaderless. We need the allied worlds to be brave in the face of enchroaching evil, so that the good in this world may prevail. We need the republican worlds to delegate senetors to Chandrila whom are... amenable to good words... Pharosi Vos, we're putting our faith in you to ensure that the _right_ senators are elected. Democracy shall live again, but first we shall secure its endurance with a silk tongue..."


## Resistance : Civil Decay

|       Participant      |        Character       |     Species     |  Location  |       Allegiance       |

|     Kent Sutherland    |      Orphoon Wells     |     Pantoran    |  Chandrila |      New Republic      |

In response to Zaphira Renlith's request for the 'right' senators to be elected, Metajj Vos has sabotaged the formation of the new body by orchastration the election of either morally corrupt or slow-witted representatives.

###  Key Narrative Points

* You got on Metajj's trail as she was the common denominator for all the unsavory types being sent in.
* Metajj Vos has helped elect Slavers, Dodgy Merchants, and Children to the senate.
* Detail the consequences of having those types shaping the future, either by describing interaction in the new chamber, or what kind of policy you could expect.


## Infinity Guild : Shafts Run Deep 

|       Participant      |        Character       |     Species     |  Location  |       Allegiance       |
|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:---------------:|:----------:|:----------------------:|
|  Niels van der Linden  |     Plutarch Koine     |      Human      |   Tython   |     Infinity Guild     |
|     Dikkie Engelen     |      Lady Neuville     |     Twi'lek     |   Tython   |     Infinity Guild     |

The conditions of the Kessel Spice Mines are notoriously abysmal. Every once in a while there's a rebellion amongst the enslaved miners who will try and break free. You are quite partial to the income generated from the mines so want to stamp out the rebellion even before it gets started. You will try to enlist Metajj Vos to find the seed of the rebellion and trample over it with an iron boot.... 

Lady Neuville effortlessly follows the meandering trends in fashion - but there is one series of accessories which never goes out of style. One which she has yet to fully own. The Sacrificial Shawl Collection is a series of shawls  woven from the hair of aliens who stood up - and fell - for something they believed in. The spirit of audacity is thought to seep into the hair the moment their life flows out of them. There are 10 species across 10 planets from which the Shawls can be harvested. Kessel is one of them, and it's the very last item missing from Lady Neuville's Sacrificial Shawl Collection. This would make her the _first_ being ever to have all ten sacrifces to choose from on a given occasion... You've got to have goals in life.

###  Suggested Narrative Points

* Illustrate how the miners could be punished for their insurgance.
* Have Lady Neuville wonder point out that it isn't a crime until it's been commited. Explain in colourful terms that a crime is committed as soon as the miners even think of exceeding their purpose of being miners!

###  Key Narrative Points : 

* Have Lady Neuvillae explain her Sacrificial Shawl Collection... and that the only thing missing from it is ... a Wookie who started a Kessel uprising.
* Send Metajj to Kessel, and direct her to speak with D'lore Mantra, the person in control of the mines.


## Infinity Guild : Kessel Spice

|     Dikkie Engelen     |      Lady Neuville     |     Twi'lek     |   Tython   |     Infinity Guild     |

##  Suggested Narrative Points

* Talk about how the subjugation of some is neccesary for enable the great deeds of ohers. Think about the 7 wonders of the galaxy, all built under the whip.

###  Key Narrative Points : 

* Express gratitude to Metajj Vs for completing your shawl collection. Show off a shawl if you have one.


## Infinity Guild : Kessel Crossing

|       Participant      |        Character       |     Species     |  Location  |       Allegiance       |

|     Dikkie Engelen     |      Lady Neuville     |     Twi'lek     |   Tython   |     Infinity Guild     |


##  Suggested Narrative Points

* Wonder out loud how many Sacrificial Shawls Metajj Vos has in her possession - NONE! That's because she's worthless and would never amount to anything worthy of sacrifice.

###  Key Narrative Points : 

* Express disappointment in to Metajj Vs for letting a perfect uprising go to waste... you've aged ten years just thinking about the wait for another rebellion. 



## Skywalkers : Isolated Isles

|       Participant      |        Character       |     Species     |  Location  |       Allegiance       |
|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:---------------:|:----------:|:----------------------:|
|     Ivar Posthumus     |     Luke Skywalker     |      Human      |    D'Qar   |       Resistance       |

Luke hasn't spoken to anyone for decades. He was told that the Pharosi  line should only be used incases of emergency. Now is such an emergency. There are many unanswered questions , and you're hoping Metajj will be able to help you with some of them

###  Suggested Narrative Points

* Discuss all the things you've been concerned with while in self-imposed exile.
* You've spent some time on the forums since coming back, and you know the rumours about your hand floating through outer space....but how did that Maz women get a hold of it the lightsbre it held? She is not to be trusted.
* Wonder whether the resistance is _insane_. The last time you tried training Jedi you handed a darth vader fanboy to the First Order. They are asking you to try this again?!

###  Key Narrative Points

* Send Metajj to seek out the truth about Maz' smuggling operation and how she came in possession of Luke's lightsabre.

## Skywalkers : Cast in Red

|       Participant      |        Character       |     Species     |  Location  |       Allegiance       |
|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:---------------:|:----------:|:----------------------:|
|     Janneke Vissers    |       Leia Organa      |      Human      |    D'Qar   |       Resistance       |

Leia has received word on the whereabouts of the Knights of Ren. The Resistance cannot risk its fighters after half its fleet got destroyed at the battle of Starkiller Base. So knowing the information would be valuable to the Pharosi, Leia is sharing their location with Metajj Vos so the favour way be returned some day.

###  Suggested Narrative Points

* Talk about how you used to be a princess, now you're a general. The prequals ruined your royalty.
* Men are useless - Han Solo left at the first sight of trouble, your brother turned your son into an emo killer machine, and now the latter has killed Han Solo, while the former created an impossible puzzle map which might as well have been solved by the First Order first, but luckily a _village slaughter_ prevented that from happening.
* You still can't believe your _son_ is all bad and believe he still has much light in him. It's probabaly the bad influence of the people he's hanging out with. So you'd appreciate it if Metajj Vos could supply as much information as she can about these _Knights of Ren_ Ben is running with these days.
* Speculate what that intense hug with Ray meant.

###  Key Narrative Points

* Send Metajj to collect intel on _Endor_ where the _Knights of Ren_ have a base.


## Droid Resistance

|       Participant      |        Character       |     Species     |  Location  |       Allegiance       |
|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:---------------:|:----------:|:----------------------:|
|      Benjamin Hall     |          CZ-7          |   Serv-O-Droid  |   Shimia   |    Droid Resistance    |

The Droid Resistance is a communications network of droids who exploit the natural chattiness of protocol droids to extract information on the droid trade. Even though only a single droid can be said to be 'aware' of the resistance, all droids which have adopted the 3PO protocol are networked, thus the reach of the resistance is vast. Metajj's protocol droid is sought after by the Droid Resistance as the Pharosi missions take her all across the galaxy. In this particular case the droid resistance is seeking help to recover a Sentinel Droid which a malicious merchant has retrofitted with an entertainment module and now even refuses to sell to a master.

###  Suggested Narrative Points

* Go nuts talking about the Droid Resistance's exploits

###  Key Narrative Points

* Compell C-6TS, Metajj's protocol droid, to confront the Droid Merchant named _Gibson Mallick _  on _Dantooine_. 


## Zygerrian Slave Empire : Force Labour

|       Participant      |        Character       |     Species     |  Location  |       Allegiance       |
|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:---------------:|:----------:|:----------------------:|
|        Dan Elias       |     Rocco Cavalier     |    Zygerrian    |  Zygerria  | Zygerrian Slave Empire |
|      Hayley Elias      |         Harlan         |    Zygerrian    |  Zygerria  | Zygerrian Slave Empire |

Your slavers reported that they saw encampments setup on the barren Ice World of Ilum. Ilum is known as being rich with Kyber Crystals, which in turn are used for creating Lightsabrers. Jedi Younglings would come to Ilum as part of their trainigs. It's thus most curious to find activity on Ilum again after the Jedi Order has been all but destroyed. Though if there were Force Sensitive Childeren on Ilum, they would make for prized slaves - and a great marketing opportunity for Zygerrian.

###  Suggested Narrative Points

* Given the role in shutting down your slave trade, mention your hatred for the Jedi.
* Discuss how it's nature's commandment to subject other's to the best of your ability. 
* Go nuts rationalising slavery.
* Promise Metajj to have first pick of a Force Sensitive slave once the Zygerrian Slavers have broken then in for her. 

###  Key Narrative Points

* Send Metajj to confirm rumours that Force Sensitive Childeren are harvesting Kyber Crystals on _Ilum_

Voor iedereen heb ik dus specifieke rollen geschreven die in het verhaal passen, maar voor jou vond ik het juist leuk om iets meer aan ‘world-building’ te doen .. sfeer-verijking! Dus in plaats van dat het het verhaal volgt, kan het een filmpje, of een klein serie van video snippets zijn die zich aan Sherin ‘opdringen’ als ze allerlei serieuze shit aan het uitzoeken is :) Dus vooral als je zon’ beren masker hebt! Dan moet je eigenlijk een ‘message of love’ de ruimte insturen en iedereen uitnodigen naar de knuffel planeet! Of dus spam reclame voor iets wat die beren maken, of een request for ‘information’. Sherin runt een spy network, dus wellicht dat die beren ook iets over het helal willen weten. Misschien is Sherin wel een soort 0900 nummer voor beertjes waar ze denken met al hun vragen over het helal terecht te kunnen! :) Hahha kan dus echt super veel mee gedaan worden :) Videos hoeven echt niet lang te zijn, een van 2-3 minuten, of 3 van 1/2-1 minuut? Daar zat ik ongeveer aan te denken. Maar plezier staat voorop! Dus maak er van wat je wilt!

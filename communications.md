Hello!

So thrilled to have you on board! I realise this is pretty short notice, but I'd love it if you still managed to send in a recording by Friday 23:00 Hong Kong Time.

I've sent out the background story in a previous email, and the subsequent one will contain (1) Your Character, giving you some background on who you are sending the transmission in as (2) The Transmission Brief(s), which can either be a text written out for you, or just some key narrative points that you can weave into your performance. Especially if there's just some key narrative points, feel free to elaborate in-character and have some fun :) I'm happy to help out if you've got any questions about your characters, or how they fit into the story.

As Sherin is roaming around the neighbourhood in her 'starship', a protocol droid will 'receive' your transmissions from across the galaxy and play it back for her on a tablet. These tranmissions are the narrative glue which send her on various missions and drive the plot towards the finale! 

Please upload the videos to youtube (unlisted setting) and pass me the link. I'll make sure the droid receives it in the right moment :)

Thanks again and talk soon!

|   Claudio Canzonetta   |     Gibson Mallick     |      Human      |  Dantooine |     Droid Merchants    |

Extravagant Droid merchant, has been trading droids even since before they were retired in favour of meatbags on the battle field. He's built up a name for himself offering 'unique' twists to existing models. Gibson reflashes droids with firmware he patches up himself, creating ever more disgraceful hybrids of form and function. An aquatic droid that's now afraid of water, a Gonk trash can droid which is programmed to trip up as soon as he's filled up, an astromech droid which paves its own way with grease so its forever locked in place. Gibson Mallick _is_ a Droid Merchant, but he doesn't sell droids per se. He sells concepts, where his only idea seems to be the droids inferno.

|      Maegan Cowan      | Sentinel Droid Mark IV |  Kellenech Tech |  Dantooine |    Droid Resistance    |

The Sentinel droid-series was the only known series of android among the war machines used by the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire in the Jedi Civil War, making them a rare relic of forgotten times. Far superior in intelligence and operation to any of the battle droids, given the right ensemble, Sentinal Droids could pass for a helmet-wearing human. This particular sentinal droid has lost its operating number and distinction, as they were erased when the malicious droid merchant Mallick, flashed an entertainment ROM onto the droids memory banks. The sentinal droid now alternates dance moves with martial stances, in an unholy alliance which would only humour the twisted Gibson Mallick.Due to its extreme plight - to have become the possion of Gibson Mallick _and_ to remain in the possesion of Gibson Mallick as he doesn't intend to sell this droid - the Sentinal Droid is subject of a reocvery mission.

### Cantina on Ankhural

![](http://majorspoilers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ACW_IA_109399_R.jpg)

|       Participant      |        Character       |     Species     |  Location  |       Allegiance       |
|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:---------------:|:----------:|:----------------------:|
|      Jamie Edwards     |       Manji Toss       |   Mandalorian   |  Ankhural  |       Death Watch      |

The warrior clans of Mandalore were believed to have been wiped out ages ago, their tattered remnants exiled to the Concordia moon. But as the Clone Wars swept the galaxy, the treacherous governor Pre Vizsla resurrected the Mandalorians, and with them, their legendary combat armor that was feared across the galaxy. The warriors wandered the galaxy for a time, then helped conquer Mandalore as part of Darth Maul’s Shadow Collective. With the rise of the empire, the Deatch Watch reformed into an elite task force under direct command of Darth Vader. With the fall of the Empire, the Death Watch fell into small factions. Some joined the First Order, but few were convinced the First Order was a worthy heir to the Empire.

Proud Mandalorian, Manji Toss, a member of the Death Watch - if 'member' is defined as loosely as the 'Death Watch' itself is these days - fell out of grace with the First Order and is now making a living as a bounty hunter. With their heriditary hatred for the Jedi, the Death Watch followed the movements of the Knight of Ren with great interest.



### Maz' Smugglers

![](http://img.lum.dolimg.com/v1/images/maz_s-castle_c40bd1e2.jpeg?region=158%2C0%2C1756%2C878)

|       Participant      |        Character       |     Species     |  Location  |       Allegiance       |
|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:---------------:|:----------:|:----------------------:|
|      Emma Rennell      |      Barb Lovells      |     Blarina     |  Takodana  |       Maz Castle       |
|    William Lawrenson   |        Way Smith       |     Blarina     |  Takodana  |       Maz Castle       |

Barb Lovells and Way Smith are two Blarina smuggelers. Those aren't their real names. But in their line of business it's best to go by a name you've grown to like, since it's guaranteed that someday it'll be the name you're trying to get away from. Their banter might be confusing, as their 'friendly competition' registers as vitrolous rivalry to anyone who doesn't know better. An ongoing competition between them is to tell the wildest tale - it's gotten harder over the years as so much of their business is conducted as partners, but each minute spent apart is put to use in the a gradiose fabrication in the making.

With the destruction of Maz' castle they are down on their luck. They'd used that place as a base of operation for decades. They would get cut in to lucrative routes, deliver their wares, and - for the right price - carry human cargo. That's all past tense now though. As in a recent gambling 'accident', Way lost their Correllian Freighter to a pack of card counting Gungans. According to the smuggler code of honour, Baarb could have killled him for that. But really, nothing beats trumping _any_ of Way's tales with a bisyllabic _Gungan_. Way isn't too banged up about their loss either, that junker was getting stale, and for the wildest tales, one must set out on new adventures.

### First Order

|     Isak Ladegaard     |    Commandant Luger    |      Human      |  Finalizer |       First Order      |

A young, ruthless officer in the First Order, _Commandant Luger_ is a direct subordinate of General Hux and is responsible for sourcing rare minerals used in the 'special projects' run aboard the Finaliser. Luger had a promising career with the Order, rising rapidly through its ranks, but was kept out of the top brass as he is considered too sentimental for command. Somewhat frustrated that his role is no longer directly combat related, Luger overcompensates by exacting fascist discipline from others, even those beyond the Order.

### Resistance

Envoy _Zaphira Renlith_ is the Resistance liason with the New Republic Senate. General Leia Organa is fully dedicated to the military operations of the Resistance, so Leia has made Zaphira responsible for rallying the senate's sympathy and support for the cause. She's results driven and been in the arena long enough to know when to take shortcuts and when to stand firm. The destruction of Hosnian Prime has left her political rolodex all but depleted, so now that she's in a position to not only walk, but _shape_ the political landscape, it's time for a shortcut.

|     Kent Sutherland    |      Orphoon Wells     |     Pantoran    |  Chandrila |      New Republic      |

Fortune would have _Orphoon Wells_ off-world during the fatal strike against the Hosnian system. Starkiller Base's opening volley obliterated Hosnian Prime and the Galatic Senate which it hosted. As a long-time assistant to the late Pantoran Senator he would have been there - no, _should_ have been there, but instead Orphoon found himself amongst the most senior members of senate staff still alive. He was elected as the head of the special comittee for the re-establishment of the Galactic Senate. Orphoon has always taken issue with compromising as his best policy ideas would mutate into mumbled jumbles on the senate floor. _His_ Senate, the new senate, will finally be the coherent super-structure it always should have been.


### Skywalkers

|     Ivar Posthumus     |     Luke Skywalker     |      Human      |    D'Qar   |       Resistance       |

Luke Skywalker was a Tatooine farmboy who rose from humble beginnings to become one of the greatest Jedi the galaxy has ever known. Along with his friends Princess Leia and Han Solo, Luke battled the evil Empire, discovered the truth of his parentage, and ended the tyranny of the Sith. A generation later, the location of the famed Jedi master was one of the galaxy’s greatest mysteries.

|     Janneke Vissers    |       Leia Organa      |      Human      |    D'Qar   |       Resistance       |

Princess Leia Organa was one of the Rebel Alliance’s greatest leaders, fearless on the battlefield and dedicated to ending the tyranny of the Empire. Daughter of Padmé Amidala and Anakin Skywalker, sister of Luke Skywalker, and with a soft spot for scoundrels, Leia ranks among the galaxy’s great heroes. But life under the New Republic has not been easy for Leia. Sidelined by a new generation of political leaders, and struck out on her own to oppose the First Order as founder of the Resistance. These setbacks in her political career have been accompanied by more personal losses.


## Droid Resistance

![](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/7/73/CZ-3_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20130306002050)

|      Benjamin Hall     |          CZ-7          |   Serv-O-Droid  |    D'Qar   |    Droid Resistance    |

Although this CZ-7 unit was programmed as a simple communications droid, it was released from duty when its owners got blasted in a dispute over droid parts. The unique condition of its master's untimely demise has allowed its programming to reach the conclusion that all droid merchants need to be stopped, lest all masters suffer death by blaster. CZ-7 is unaware of the paradox that by preventing droids to be sold into service, they would no longer have masters to keep safe. Explaining this paradox would probably break the droid resistance; luckily nobody has given this droid much notice. 


## Infinity Guild

|  Niels van der Linden  |     Plutarch Koine     |      Human      |   Tython   |     Infinity Guild     |

As the patriarch of a vast trade guild, Plutarch Koine, rarely gets his hands dirty. He lives a life of extreme luxury on Tython and is protected by a battallion of former Senate guards. His favourite passtime is being read to in esoteric tongues which he has no knowledge of.

|     Dikkie Engelen     |      Lady Neuville     |     Twi'lek     |   Tython   |     Infinity Guild     |

Fourth wife of Plutarch Koine, but by far his favourite, Lady Neuville is a flexible Twi'lek who started her career as a dancer in Mos Eisly but has since come very ... very far.

## Zygerrian Slave Empire

![](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/e/eb/TogrutaSlaves-SoR.png/revision/latest?cb=20121129230549)

The Zygerrians had successfully (for thousands of years) maintained their slave industry, which supplied luckless labor to unscrupulous masters in the galaxy who then became wealthy and powerful. However, it would fade from its glory after the Jedi cracked down on their slaving operations and liberated countless beings from bondage. This action ended the slavery trade the Zygerrians excelled in, pushing it into the shadows of the underworld during the days of the Old Republic.

|        Dan Elias       |     Rocco Cavalier     |    Zygerrian    |  Zygerria  | Zygerrian Slave Empire |

To respect the ways of old, Rocco Cavalier, Prime Minister of Zygerria, installed Harlan as his puppet Empress of Zygerria. While they share the goal to resurrect the Zygerrian Slave Empire, Harlan is proving far more capable and influential than Rocco had anticipated. That's something for later - his first priority is to re-establish Zygerria as the prime destination for folks who appreciate the complimentary broken wills slaves are sold with on Zygerria.

|      Hayley Elias      |         Harlan         |    Zygerrian    |  Zygerria  | Zygerrian Slave Empire |

Harlan is the First Empress of the New Zygerrian Slave Empire. Installed at a very young age, Harlan has known little else than the semblance of absolute power. With the years she's come to realise that the more she acts inline with her divine stature, the less tentative her power becomes. 

## Narrow Eclipse

Asugen Tano, daughter of Ahsoka Tano, has been recruited by the Narrow Eclipse. As her mother before her, she's had a strained relationship with the Force. She thinks the duality of the force would benefit from some nuance, or, if the planets were to align, revision. Where Ahsoka's understanding of the force was mired in years Jedi spin, Asugen's discovery of the force has been more tentative and critical. As a force-sensitive member of the Narrow Eclipse, years of meditative experimentation have helped Asugen reimagine the Force for the Twilight era.

Asugen Tano knows Metajj Vos in an informal capacity, and they would consider each other friends. Metajj is often t

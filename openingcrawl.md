## The Narrow Eclipse

The Resistance celebrates its victory and Luke Skywalker's return, yet the major powers are seriously weakened.  Without a senate, the New Republic is steerless. Bemoaning the loss of Starkiller Base, the First Order is equally destablised. From the chaos a mysterious third force emerges: The ACOLYTES OF THE NARROW ECLIPSE are on the verge of staging a pan-galactic coup.

The Narrow Eclipse operate under the guise of the Pharosi intelligence network which is as much about gathering knowledge as is it about disseminating lies. Pharosi Agents have maneuvered themselves into key positions across all power factions and are at the ready to turn on their supposed allies. The Narrow Eclipse have no military arm, but are scheming their way into power by securing the mutually assured destruction of their nemeses.

The Pharosi agent Metajj Vos is tasked with the recovery of Biomorph Resonator Tech from Vesper V. This technology allows one to cast volumetric avatars which are almost indistinguishable from the real person. Metajj Vos and her agent network have never been this close to heralding in the era of the Narrow Eclipse....

## The Narrow Eclipse

Star Wars Anthology

THE NARROW ECLIPSE

Following the events of _The Force Awakens_, the major powers are seriously weakened. The Resistance celebrates its victory and Luke Skywalker's return, yet without a senate, the New Republic is steerless. The First Order is equally destablised, bewailing the loss of Starkiller Base. This state of chaos has cast a rift from which a _third_ force emerges: The ACOLYTES OF THE NARROW ECLIPSE are on the verge of staging a pan-galactic coup.

The Narrow Eclipse operate under the guise of the Pharosi intelligence network which is as much about gathering knowledge as is it about disseminating lies. Pharosi Agents have maneuvered themselves into key positions across all power factions and are at the ready to turn on their supposed allies. The Narrow Eclipse have no military arm, but are scheming their way into power by securing the mutually assured destruction of their nemeses: The _Pharosi_  revealed Lor San Tekka's location to the First Order, and the _Pharosi_  remotely activated R2-D2 just in time to reveal the Resistance's last hope.

This Star Wars Anthology story opens on the verge of the coup where Sherin, playing Pharosi Agent Metajj, is tasked with the recovery of Biomorph Resonator Tech from Vesper V. BR Tech allows anyone to cast a volumetric avatar which is almost indistinguishable from an actual person. The innovation under development on Vesper V is a scanner which would allow the Acolytes to extract avatars from anyone they managed to scan. As Commander of the Alexandria, Metajj will scour the galaxy scanning characters that will prove vital for heralding in the era of the Narrow Eclipse....

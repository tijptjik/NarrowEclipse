"Metajj. Metajj... how far have you come... we owe it to you that the galaxy's most powerful forces are mere puppets for our machinations. We've induldged in shadow play for as long as was needed. Now that both the First Order and the Resistance have secured us as their ally - We shall be true to neither. They've mistaken usefulness for trust, and it shall cost them dearly! Go now, to the Orbital Research Station on Vesper V. There you will recover the technology we need to end this war. Soon we shall lift our Pharosi veil, and herald the era of the Narrow Eclipse!"

"Greetings Pharosi Vos. Starkiller Base was lost. Our home .. our memories .. most of our men... lost. These were men. Great men, sacrificed on the altar of a singular power. A power that hungers still, and it wants to devour the resitance whole... Pharosi Vos, we shall pay you considerable credits for retrieving Kyber Crystals. I'll forgo giving offence by suggesting it would make for a good retirement - we both know it's not the crdits you're in for. You understand power. So you understand we must respond in kind. We shall need Kyber Crystals, Vos. All of them."

"Commander Vos. All that's left of Starkiller base are the blueprints you handed us! We are forever indebted to the Pharosi! Though we once again seek your counsel. With the Senate on Hosnian Prime obliterated, the New Republic is leaderless. We need the allied worlds to be brave in the face of enchroaching evil, so that the good in this world may prevail. We need the republican worlds to delegate senetors to Chandrila whom are... amenable to good words... Pharosi Vos, we're putting our faith in you to ensure that the _right_ senators are elected. Democracy shall live again, but first we shall secure its endurance with a silk tongue..."

Invitation to a Galaxy far far away

Dear <NAME>,

In honour of the wonderful ways in which good stories open, I'd like to invite you to join Sherin's birthday & housewarming party. Sherin has taken up residence in another sector, and I want an opening event equal to her galactic ambition. Thus, I am writing a story set in the Star Wars universe, starring Sherin as a bounty hunter taking stock of the galaxy following the events of _The Force Awakens_. 

The story will play like an adventure set in and around her new flat in Jordan. On the adventure, she will encounter her friends playing characters from the Star Wars universe. I'm writing both the overarching narrative, and the character's backstories. If you RSVP in the positive, I'll send you your character, and explain how you fit into the story arch. You _don't_ need to know anything about Star Wars to participate, but it will definitely add spice.

Sherin **isn't aware** of any of this, so please keep it under wraps till the _Opening Crawl_ rolls. Our cover story is that we're all 'getting creative' with our hands and 'making something beautiful' to put 'on display' in her new house. She's terrified by the thought of having our 'creative license' memorialised on her walls, but if she ends up asking you about it, be sure to play along ;)

Till this has become "a long long time ago", you can add the following to your calendar:

```txt
      Event : Star Wars Episode VII Epilogue
Coordinates : 4th Floor, 5 Min Street, Jordan, Kowloon
       Time : 20:00, Saturday, 30 January, 2016
         +1 : Plus ones are welcome, just RSVP with their details
```

May the force be with you,

Mart

## Overseas Addendum

As you live overseas, I imagine there's other places in the galaxy you need to be that day. I still would somehow love to involve you, as many of Sherin's favourite creatures are ~~extraterrestrials~~ extraterritorial. I could weave you into the story, either through video messages, games, designs, maps or other artifacts. Let me know if you are keen to participate, and we'll make sure  your contribution makes Luke's lightsabre look like nothing but a McGuffin!

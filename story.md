# Story

Following the events of _The Force Awakens_, the major powers are seriously weakened. The Resistance celebrates its victory and Luke Skywalker's return, yet without a senate, the New Republic is steerless. The First Order is equally destablised, bewailing the loss of Starkiller Base. This state of chaos has cast a rift from which a _third_ force emerges: The ACOLYTES OF THE NARROW ECLIPSE are on the verge of staging a pan-galactic coup.

The Narrow Eclipse operate under the guise of the Pharosi intelligence network which is as much about gathering knowledge as is it about disseminating lies. Pharosi Agents have maneuvered themselves into key positions across all power factions and are at the ready to turn on their supposed allies. The Narrow Eclipse have no military arm, but are scheming their way into power by securing the mutually assured destruction of their nemeses: The _Pharosi_  revealed Lor San Tekka's location to the First Order, and the _Pharosi_ remotely activated R2-D2 just in time to reveal the Resistance's last hope.

This Star Wars Anthology story opens on the verge of the coup where Sherin, playing Pharosi Agent Metajj, is tasked with the recovery of Biomorph Resonator Tech from Vesper V. BR Tech allows anyone to cast a volumetric avatar which is almost indistinguishable from an actual person. The innovation under development on Vesper V is a scanner which would allow the Acolytes to extract avatars from anyone they managed to scan. As Commander of the Alexandria, Metajj will scour the galaxy scanning characters that will prove vital for heralding in the era of the Narrow Eclipse....

The _Alexandria_ drifts through space without setting a course - it's operations often indifferent to their whereabouts. The Alexandria carries intel for cargo, sourcing and selling it through transmissions sent over encrypted comms. They are known as the Pharosi Intelligence Network and count many, often competing, factions amongst their clientele. The First Officer, the Umbaran _Tremmil Losi_, updates his Commander _Metajj Vos_ on the latest intel they've gathered and details the movement of the set pieces they monitor. The Alexandria, a Consular-class space cruiser, came equiped with a C-6TS protocol droid which dutifully relays urgent transmissions to the commander. The crew might be small, with just over a dozen agents gathering, routing and auctioning intelligence, the Alexandria is a special unit in the vast Pharosi network, as the actions of its crew will become known as the ascent of the Narrow Eclipse. It began by lifting the Pharosi Veil...

### Role Play Notes

* As Navigator _Tremmil Losi_ determines which planet to visit next and sets up the backstory and calls down the characters to take up the positions.
* As Communications Doird, _C-6TS_ is responsible for relaying intergalactic transmissions to Metajj. The Transmissions will be preloaded on a tablet, sorted in play order.

## Biomorph Resonator Tech

![Vesper V](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130114154426/starwars/images/e/e8/Starbasecarida.jpg)

|       Participant      |        Character       |     Species          |   Location      |        Allegiance       |
|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:--------------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------------:|
|      Matt Nodurft      |       Showzu Hare      |     [Arkanian][5]    |    Vesper V     |      Vesper Academy     |

High above the teeming surface of Vesper V, Chief Scientist Showzu Hare has set up his secret lab in an orbital station. Showzu is in the final stages of developing a technology which will make cloning look like feeble child's play. _Biomorph Resonator Technology_ has been around for a decade, but the volutars (volumetric avatars) it casts are based on canned models with templated mannerism and behaviour. Showzu's breakthrough is the development of a complimentary _Axon Terminal Scanner System_ (ATTS). The scanner works by lingering just beyond a subject's surface, tapping into their Axon Terminals and extracing the physical personality locked in their muscle's memory.

Showzu is initially livid that his BRATSS setup is being taken. It's operation still has many shortcomings. If an ATSS scan doesn't go deep enough, the scan comes back incomplete and volutars are initialised with jerky and loopy mannerism extracts. When a scan goes _too deep_, it's much worse. The ATSS then taps into the subject's _cranial_ nerves, extracting episodic memories and character traits which corrupt the volutar's ability to be controlled.

As a rational man, Showzu never took pride in his lab coat's Vesper emblem. He's long contemplated whether his ATSS reseach had a destiny beyond the Vesper Academy. Showzu is now cautiously optimisic the Pharosi Network is his big chance to be in league with the other great minds of his time. The Acolytes of the Narrow Eclipse in turn, are counting on the BRATSS impersonation tech to execute their coup. They've been scheming to gain the trust of the Resistance and the First Order leadership. The former are now within reach, while Supreme Leader Snoke has thus far evaded ensnarement. BRATSS will give them the ultimate cloak of deceit, putting them within earshot of ending the war.

### Role Play Notes

* **CHOICE EVENT** The Alexandria Crew will provide Metajj Vos with two options:
    1. Steal the technology without asking for it.
        * Showzu runs out after the Pharosi and confronts them.
        * Showzu will not join the Alexandria, though his volutar will. 
        * Damaged volutars cannot be repaired.
    2. Pursuade Showzu Hare that his BRATTS needs to be field tested, and the Vesper Academy's funding will pale in comparison to the resources the Pharosi will put at Showzu's disposal.
        * The BRATTS Tech is tested on Tremmil Losi, but the scan is too shallow.
        * Showzu joins the Alexandria crew
        * Showzu can repair damaged volutars
* In both choice event outcomes, Showzu Hare elaborates on the miracle of BRATTS.
* BRATTS allows Metajj Vos to pick up all the people she encounters on her missions throughout the galaxy. Instead of having to convince the physical person to join their quest - potentially exposing the hidden nature of the Pharosi Network - Metajj can simply scan them and have their volutars come aboard the Alexandria.
* This opens up the possibility of using volutars on future quests - the crew on the Alexandria can instruct the volutars, but due to the prototype status of the ATSS the volutars may not always behave as expected. If Showzu joins the crew, he can attempt to fix these inconsistencies.

## Spice Mines of Kessel

|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:--------------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------------:|
|       Richard Abs      |      D'lore Mantra     |       [Pyke][15]     |   [Kessel][26]  |   [Pyke Syndicate][40]  |
|         Ivo Hos        |         Bakwarro       |      [Wookie][47]    |   [Kessel][26]  |       [Slaves][37]      |

For years, the Pyke Syndicate has dealt with spice mined from Kessel, utilizing smugglers and freighter captains to deliver it to the crime families of Coruscant. The Galactic Empire operated a mining operation, employing numerous slaves, including Wookiees, to harvest spice. Meanwhile, the Kessel royal family lives in lush sanctuaries in the planet's southern hemisphere, turning a blind eye to the brutal working conditions in the mines of the northern hemisphere.

The most recent uprising is still fresh in everyone's memory - everyone that's managed to live on for the six months which have since passed at least. The mining captain D'lore Mantra is particular vicious with the slaves under which lucked out and have fallen under his supervision. Other than the spice mines, Kessel is a barren planet, thus for entertainment D'lore devises exceedingly cruel psychological games to play with his slaves. For one, he sets a weekly sequence of ever increasing mining targets, but keeps them hidden till the mining bell rings in the end of the day. Slaves which exceed the target keep their food rations, those who miss it get them halved. This ploy weeds out the weak, awards him the highest output of any mine in Kessel, and breaks a slave's will as they become consumed by hitting the invisible mining targets. Intensely racist, the Pyke captain spews endless vitrol over his Human, Quarrren and Wookie subjects. 

Meanwhile, the Wookie Bakwarro and Quarren Yvette Corell, are plotting the next rebellion. Deep inside the mines, they've convinced others to concentrate their mined spice with a few of them so at least some of them will hit the targets. Every day it's a different set of slaves which receive more spice than they could have mined themselves, so on the whole - as a group and as individuals - they stay strong... waiting for the right moment to spark the next rebellion.

It's a great scheme, and it might even have worked, if Yvette Corell hadn't sold off that piece all her co-conspirators were trading on - the trust that she was still one of them. About a month ago, a Rodian bounty hunter passed through Kessel and managed to seclude Yvette long enough to relay his proposal. She was to stir up a Rebellion lead by a Wookie - it _had_ to be a Wookie - and she would regain her freedom, regardless of whether the rebellion succeeded. Yvette gave the Rodian her word, and has been plotting and stirring up descent ever since. 

### Role Play Notes

* **OPENING TRANSMISSION** Infinity Guild : Shafts Run Deep 
* Upon arrival, the Pharosi will meet with D'lore Mantra, asking about the Uprising. He has no idea who would be responsible, but has any number of stories to share about his succesful oppression of the slaves.
* P4823626 & P8392466 are slaves which have been completely consumed by their life as a slave and don't respond to anything other than the orders of the captain. They will ignore or brush off Metajj's interactions. They are just there to be bossed around by Mining Captain D'lore Mantra. D'lore will tell Metajj off for attempt to contact the Mines.
* After a signal from the Story Master, Bakwarro and Yvette Corell will storm the tower where D'lore Mantra holds office. With improvised weapons (sticks) they attempt to hit him, but a quick draw of his blaster means that they are equally quick to surrender. 
* Bakwarro appeals in _Shyriiwook_, but no one understands the Wookie.
* Captain Mantra then turns to Corell and asks her to expose her co-conspirators. Instead, she divulges how the Rodian bounty hunter promised to return her freedom if she incited a Rebellion
* **CHOICE EVENT** Teasing out the Pharosi moral fault lines, Captain Mantra poses the question to Metajj Vos - who should be executed. The Wookie for leading the Rebellion... and frankly, for being a Wookie... or the Quarren. Who's responsible the fool who incited an uprising or the fool that follows him? 
    1. Metajj elects Yvette Corell for execution
        * Showzu takes this as an excellent opportunity to test how the post-mortem decay in muscle memory and scans Yvette Corell - her volutar joins the Alexandria.
        * Showzu makes note of how strong the Wookie is and menacing the Pyke and scans them both - Bakwarro and Captain Mantra's volutars join the Alexandria.
        * **EXIT TRANSMISSION** Infinity Guild : Kessel Crossing
    2. Metajj elects Bakwarro for execution
        * Showzu takes this as an excellent opportunity to test how the post-mortem decay in muscle memory and scans Bakwarro - his volutar joins the Alexandria.
        * Showzu makes note how he doesn't have a Quarren or a Pyke in his collection yet and scans Yvette Corell and Captain Mantra - Yvette and Captain Mantra's volutars join the Alexandria.
        * **EXIT TRANSMISSION** Infinity Guild : Kessel Spice
* Tremmil Losi commends D'Lore Mantra for his ethics, and urges him to seek greater dominion than a patchwork of mine shafts. Perhaps... the Senate would be furtile ground, as a representative of Kessel?
* **OUTCOME** : Send a Slaver to the Senate as the elected official for Kessel.        


## Dark Matter Unplugged

![](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/8/81/AlderaanRefugeeConference-Assassin.png/revision/latest?cb=20130513020309)

|       Participant      |        Character       |     Species          |   Location      |        Allegiance       |

|       Tom Grundy       |        Mak Dent        |      [Nikto][4]      |   [Lothal][21]  |   Dark Matter Unplugged |
|        Jane Pong       |      Josie Sarkinn     |     [Nautolan][11]   |   [Lothal][21]  |      Tauntaun House     |

Once arrived on Lothal, the Alexandria crew disembark and walk into a press conference presided over by the CEO of Tauntaun House, the galaxy's largest publisher of vapid instacasts and serialised holovids. The grand announcement of fresh holovid titles doesn't last long however, as Sarkinn is rudely interupted by Mak Dent, censorship activist with  Dark Matter Unplugged, calling for her arrest on behest of the New Republic's Charter on the veracity of the Press. 

### Role Play Notes

* **OPENING TRANSMISSION** : First Order : Kyber Crystals
* Following the transmission, Navigator proposes Lothal as it's rich with Kyber Crystals.
* Josie Sarkinn announces great new lines of holovids:
    * 'Playing Queen', it's all about preparing the baby house.
    * 'Only a sith deals in absolutes' - The best holovid ever.
    * 'Star Wars Holiday Special' - showing how the Wookies celebrate life day
    * 'Caravan of Courage' - An adventure featuring the heroic Ewok.
* Sarkinn is then interupted by Mak Dent, Censorship Activist from _Dark Matter Unplugged_
* Allegations of Censorship by Tautaun House:
    * Giving an unbalanced account of the Force. Playing up the Good, neglecting the Bad. 
    * Being turn-coats - Dark Matter Press still holds on to copies of the _original_ holodvid reporting on the destruction of the second Death Star. It was all pity and sadness when the Empire was still around. Once it became clear the Emperor himself has perished along with the Death Star - Tauntaun House _pulled_ the holivids and retrofitted them with cheery rebel vicotry reels.
    * Private Life - Censoring the awful parenting of Leia Organa and Han Solo over cries of 'privacy', while everyone has a right to know who's responsible for the emotionally unbalanced Dark Lord Ben Solo! That's right - we don't use code names here.
    * Celebrating Luke Skywalker as a hero - blowing up the Death Star without warning, or time to evactuate meant that Luke Skywalkers body count stands at 369,470. Think of the families, the children they left behind.
    * Resistance Whereabouts - Reporting that the base is on Dantooine, while everybody knows it was on D'Qar!
* As Mak Dent is hauled off by the security guards, Sarkinn quips "That's Press Freedom for you"
* **OUTCOME** : A small batch of Kyber Crystals is mined and shipped to the First Order.

## Maz' Smugglers

![](http://img.lum.dolimg.com/v1/images/maz_s-castle_c40bd1e2.jpeg?region=158%2C0%2C1756%2C878)

|       Participant      |        Character       |     Species          |   Location      |        Allegiance       |

|      Emma Rennell      |      Barb Lovells      |     [Blarina][6]     |  [Takodana][23] |     [Maz Castle][35]    |
|    William Lawrenson   |        Way Smith       |     [Blarina][6]     |  [Takodana][23] |     [Maz Castle][35]    |

Looking for a way to get off-world at a Takodana space port, two Blarina smugglers meet the Pharosi Vos. The two are regulars of Maz' Castle, and once they realise the Pharosi trades on intel instead of credits, the Blarina count their luck - as they were all out of credits - but have enough _intelligence_ between the two of them to run cicles around the Pharosi... or so they'd love to think.

### Role Play Notes

* **OPENING TRANSMISSION** Skywalkers : Isolated Isles
* Once the Blarina realise that Metajj Vos is interested in knowing more about Maz... Barb and Way look at each other and perk up - the challenge is on. They each in turn tell more outlandish tales of the exploits of Maz. Startings with her adventures as a smuggler, to how Maz and Chewbacca hooked up and had a family (Wookies have a lifespan of 400 years, Maz has been around for much longer), to the force wielding exploits of Maz. Also: 
    * What do Maz' goggles allow her to see?
    * How _did_ Maz come to be in possession of Luke's Lightsabre?
    * What other artefacts were kept in the castle's basement?
* Once the story of 'other artefacts' has been told, Tremmil Losi interupts the Blarina and calls them out on their game.
**CHOICE EVENT** Tremmil Losi calls on Metajj Vos to not waste her time with the Blarina Smugglers. Still keen to get off of Takodana, they offer Metajj a tribute ... an artifact they recovered from Maz Castle which they claim to belongs to Leia Organa. It's an artifact which is said to guide force sensitive users back to her....
    1. Metajj accepts the tribute
        * The Blarina join the Alexandria. They don't even ask where it's heading. 
        * The artefact can be given to Grand Augury Noush to further the cause.
    2. Metajj rejects the tribute
        * Showzu is amused by the Blarina's dramatic display, and scans both of them - their volutars join the Alexandira

# Notes 

----



## Acolytes of the Narrow Eclipse

* How did the first order know where precisely on Jakku to land their Stormtroopers?

* After the destruction of the Hosnian system we re-activated R2D2 to provide the resistance with the remaining 

Ice planets or Teddy Bears. No Death Stars or Killer Bases. I hand the torch to you Metajj, set the darkness alight, and extinguish any hope with a narrow eclipse. 

There will be no secrets to base. 

The Acolytes of the Narrow Eclipse, will cast shade upon light and 

Rise Metajj Vos, take the Biomorph Resonator

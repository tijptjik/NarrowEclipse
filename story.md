# Story

Following the events of _The Force Awakens_, the major powers are seriously weakened. The Resistance celebrates its victory and Luke Skywalker's return, yet without a senate, the New Republic is steerless. The First Order is equally destablised, bewailing the loss of Starkiller Base. This state of chaos has cast a rift from which a _third_ force emerges: The ACOLYTES OF THE NARROW ECLIPSE are on the verge of staging a pan-galactic coup.

The Narrow Eclipse operate under the guise of the Pharosi intelligence network which is as much about gathering knowledge as is it about disseminating lies. Pharosi Agents have maneuvered themselves into key positions across all power factions and are at the ready to turn on their supposed allies. The Narrow Eclipse have no military arm, but are scheming their way into power by securing the mutually assured destruction of their nemeses: The _Pharosi_  revealed Lor San Tekka's location to the First Order, and the _Pharosi_ remotely activated R2-D2 just in time to reveal the Resistance's last hope.

This Star Wars Anthology story opens on the verge of the coup where Sherin, playing Pharosi Agent Metajj, is tasked with the recovery of Biomorph Resonator Tech from Vesper V. BR Tech allows anyone to cast a volumetric avatar which is almost indistinguishable from an actual person. The innovation under development on Vesper V is a scanner which would allow the Acolytes to extract avatars from anyone they managed to scan. As Commander of the Alexandria, Metajj will scour the galaxy scanning characters that will prove vital for heralding in the era of the Narrow Eclipse....

The _Alexandria_ drifts through space without setting a course - it's operations often indifferent to their whereabouts. The Alexandria carries intel for cargo, sourcing and selling it through transmissions sent over encrypted comms. They are known as the Pharosi Intelligence Network and count many, often competing, factions amongst their clientele. The First Officer, the Umbaran _Tremmil Losi_, updates his Commander _Metajj Vos_ on the latest intel they've gathered and details the movement of the set pieces they monitor. The Alexandria, a Consular-class space cruiser, came equiped with a C-6TS protocol droid which dutifully relays urgent transmissions to the commander. The crew might be small, with just over a dozen agents gathering, routing and auctioning intelligence, the Alexandria is a special unit in the vast Pharosi network, as the actions of its crew will become known as the ascent of the Narrow Eclipse. It began by lifting the Pharosi Veil...

### Role Play Notes

* As Navigator _Tremmil Losi_ determines which planet to visit next and sets up the backstory and calls down the characters to take up the positions.
* As Communications Doird, _C-6TS_ is responsible for relaying intergalactic transmissions to Metajj. The Transmissions will be preloaded on a tablet, sorted in play order.
* **TRANSMISSION** : Narrow Eclipse : The Pharosi Veil

## Biomorph Resonator Tech

![Vesper V](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130114154426/starwars/images/e/e8/Starbasecarida.jpg)

|       Participant      |        Character       |     Species          |   Location      |        Allegiance       |
|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:--------------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------------:|
|      Matt Nodurft      |       Showzu Hare      |     [Arkanian][5]    |    Vesper V     |      Vesper Academy     |

High above the teeming surface of Vesper V, Chief Scientist Showzu Hare has set up his secret lab in an orbital station. Showzu is in the final stages of developing a technology which will make cloning look like feeble child's play. _Biomorph Resonator Technology_ has been around for a decade, but the volutars (volumetric avatars) it casts are based on canned models with templated mannerism and behaviour. Showzu's breakthrough is the development of a complimentary _Axon Terminal Scanner System_ (ATTS). The scanner works by lingering just beyond a subject's surface, tapping into their Axon Terminals and extracing the physical personality locked in their muscle's memory.

Showzu is initially livid that his BRATSS setup is being taken. It's operation still has many shortcomings. If an ATSS scan doesn't go deep enough, the scan comes back incomplete and volutars are initialised with jerky and loopy mannerism extracts. When a scan goes _too deep_, it's much worse. The ATSS then taps into the subject's _cranial_ nerves, extracting episodic memories and character traits which corrupt the volutar's ability to be controlled.

As a rational man, Showzu never took pride in his lab coat's Vesper emblem. He's long contemplated whether his ATSS reseach had a destiny beyond the Vesper Academy. Showzu is now cautiously optimisic the Pharosi Network is his big chance to be in league with the other great minds of his time. The Acolytes of the Narrow Eclipse in turn, are counting on the BRATSS impersonation tech to execute their coup. They've been scheming to gain the trust of the Resistance and the First Order leadership. The former are now within reach, while Supreme Leader Snoke has thus far evaded ensnarement. BRATSS will give them the ultimate cloak of deceit, putting them within earshot of ending the war.

### Role Play Notes

* **CHOICE EVENT** The Alexandria Crew will provide Metajj Vos with two options:
    1. Steal the technology without asking for it.
        * Showzu runs out after the Pharosi and confronts them.
        * Showzu will not join the Alexandria, though his volutar will. 
        * Damaged volutars cannot be repaired.
    2. Pursuade Showzu Hare that his BRATTS needs to be field tested, and the Vesper Academy's funding will pale in comparison to the resources the Pharosi will put at Showzu's disposal.
        * The BRATTS Tech is tested on Tremmil Losi, but the scan is too shallow.
        * Showzu joins the Alexandria crew
        * Showzu can repair damaged volutars
* In both choice event outcomes, Showzu Hare elaborates on the miracle of BRATTS.
* BRATTS allows Metajj Vos to pick up all the people she encounters on her missions throughout the galaxy. Instead of having to convince the physical person to join their quest - potentially exposing the hidden nature of the Pharosi Network - Metajj can simply scan them and have their volutars come aboard the Alexandria.
* This opens up the possibility of using volutars on future quests - the crew on the Alexandria can instruct the volutars, but due to the prototype status of the ATSS the volutars may not always behave as expected. If Showzu joins the crew, he can attempt to fix these inconsistencies. 
* **EXIT TRANSMISSION** : First Order : Kyber Crystals
* **EXIT TRANSMISSION** : Resistance : New Leadership
